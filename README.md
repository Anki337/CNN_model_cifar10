Reference
This tech report (Chapter 3) describes the dataset and the methodology followed when collecting it in much greater detail. Please cite it if you intend to use this dataset.
 - Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images, Alex Krizhevsky, 2009.



HOW TO USE:

1. Clone the GitHub repository or download the source code from the release page.
2. Navigate to the project directory and the subfolers venv\Scripts\ in cmd using CD (EXAMPLE: cd C:\Users\username\downloads\flaskCNN\venv\Scripts)
3. Type "activate" to activate the venv (Virtual Environment). Successfully doing so will result in the console displaying (venv) infront of the current path (EXAMPLE: (venv) C:\Users\username\downloads\flaskCNN\venv\Scripts).
4. Install the necessary dependencies by running the following command: pip install -r requirements.txt (This will install all the required packages and dependencies for the project).
5. Once the previous steps are completed you can type "flask run" in the console and it will provide a html link to your local port, copy this and paste into your webbrowers searchbar and hit enter.
