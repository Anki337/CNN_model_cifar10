This tech report (Chapter 3) describes the dataset and the methodology followed when collecting it in much greater detail. Please cite it if you intend to use this dataset.
 - Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images, Alex Krizhevsky, 2009.



HOW TO USE:

1. Clone the GitHub repository or download the source code from the release page.
2. Navigate to the project directory in cmd using CD (EXAMPLE: cd C:\Users\username\downloads\flaskCNN)
3. Create a virtual environment using the following command: "python -m venv venv"
4. Activate the virtual environment using these commands =  for Windows: "venv\Scripts\activate" , for Mac: "source venv/bin/activate"
5. Install the necessary dependencies by running the following command: pip install -r requirements.txt (This will install all the required packages and dependencies for the project).
